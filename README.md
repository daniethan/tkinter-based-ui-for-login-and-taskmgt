# tkinter-based-ui-for-login-and-taskmgt
A python tkinter-based desktop app project that allows user to login, manage tasks, and view system information/properties
This project was basically a security class assignment that on behalf of the group I implemented using python programming language.
I chose python because of the knowledge and experience I have accumulated having used a language for at least 3 years as of now.

In this project, I implemented the following:
1. UI using tkinter and customertkinter python modules (library)
2. Login functionality
3. Database interaction using sqlAlchemy and SQLite3
4. Creation of user accounts
5. Viewing running tasks on the computer using the subprocess module
6. Searching and running programs in the Program Files directory on Windows machine 
7. Viewing system properties leveraging cmd commands thru the subprocess module
8. 2FA using OTP via email and password
9. Password hashing using passlib library and bcrypt
